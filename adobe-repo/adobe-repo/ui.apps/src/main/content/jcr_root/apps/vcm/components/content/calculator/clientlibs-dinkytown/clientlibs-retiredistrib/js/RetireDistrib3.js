The SECURE Act of 2019 changed the age that RMDs must begin. If you were born on or after 7/1/1949 your first RMD will be for the year you turn 72. If you were born before 7/1/1949 the age remains 70 1/2. The SECURE Act did not change how the RMD is calculated; it only changed the age that they start. These rules took effect January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020. <p>The CARES Act of 2020 provided a temporary waiver of RMDs. The RMD waiver is for retirement plans and accounts for 2020. This includes direct contribution plans such as 401k, 403b, 457b plans and IRAs. RMDs are also waived for IRA owners who turned 70 1/2 in 2019 and were required to take an RMD by April 1, 2020 and have not yet done so.</p><p>If you have RMD questions, please consult with your own tax advisor regarding your specific situation. If you are under 75 and this RMD is from a 403(b) plan, you may not be required to take distributions on the balance in your account before 1987 until you reach age 75. You may need to contact a financial planner or CPA to determine if this exception applies to your RMD. <p><strong>IMPORTANT! This calculator has been updated for the SECURE Act of 2019 and the CARES Act of 2020. The IRS, however, has not yet released procedures for their implementation.
