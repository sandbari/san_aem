            <div class="terms-conditions">
                <p><strong>The following terms and conditions will apply to your TOD accounts:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you are establishing a new account, you must also complete and submit a Victory Funds Account Application.</li>
                    <li>In addition to accounts designated according to this Form that will be TOD accounts, any Victory Funds account that is established by an exchange from such account will be held as TOD registration.</li>
                    <li>The only accounts eligible for TOD registration are individual accounts or joint tenants with rights of survivorship (JTWROS) accounts registered in the names of two or more individuals (the account owner). (Note that accounts with joint tenants in common registration, retirement accounts, community property accounts, and entity accounts such as trusts, corporations, and partnerships, are not eligible for TOD registration.)</li>
                    <li>You must name your beneficiaries in this Form or accompanying document.</li>
                    <li>Eligible beneficiaries include individuals or entities such as trusts. However, the Victory Funds will not accept primary or secondary beneficiary designations of the account owner's lineal descendents unless the descendent is specifically named (i.e., LDPS designations are not acceptable).</li>
                    <li>For TOD accounts registered to one individual account owner, upon the death of the account owner, the TOD account will be transferred to the beneficiaries according to this Form. For TOD accounts registered as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, upon the death of the last surviving account owner, the TOD account will be transferred to the beneficiaries as according to this Form. Proof of death of the account owner(s) must be presented in a form and manner acceptable to the Victory Funds and must include a certified copy of the death certificate of the account owner(s) and any other documents required by the Victory Funds.</li>
                    <li>The last designation received and accepted by Victory Capital prior to the death of the account owner or, for TOD accounts registered as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, the last surviving joint account owner (the designation of record) will be controlling and, whether or not it fully disposes of the TOD account, will revoke all other such designations previously accepted by the Victory Funds for the TOD account.</li>
                    <li>The account owner or, for TOD accounts registered as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, the last surviving joint account owner, may cancel or change the beneficiaries at any time, by providing notice to the Victory Funds in a form and manner acceptable to the Victory Funds. Beneficiaries have no right in or to, and the designation of a beneficiary has no effect on the ownership of, the TOD account while any account owner is living.</li>
                    <li>If no beneficiaries survive the account owner (or the last surviving joint account owner), then the TOD account will be transferred to the estate of the account owner (or the last surviving joint account owner). If the Victory Funds, in its sole and absolute discretion, cannot reasonably identify the beneficiary of a TOD account or determines that a beneficiary designation is invalid, ineffective, or unclear, then the portion of the TOD account which otherwise would have passed to such beneficiary will instead be transferred to the estate of the account owner (or the last surviving joint account owner).</li>
                    <li>You should consult your legal or tax advisor to determine whether a TOD registration is appropriate for your specific situation. By accepting a beneficiary designation of record, the Victory Funds will not assume and will have no responsibility or liability with respect to the legal or tax consequences of the designation, including but not limited to the impact on the designation of community property laws or laws governing inheritance of property.</li>
                    <li>The TOD account owner delegates to the Victory Funds the power to amend at any time, and from time to time, these terms and provisions and consents to such amendments, provided they comply with applicable law. Any such amendments will be effective as of the date specified in a written notice sent by first-class mail to the address of the account owner (or to the beneficiary following the death of the TOD account owner(s)) indicated by the records of the Victory Funds.</li>
                    <li>The Victory Funds will have the right to rely upon any information furnished by the TOD account owner(s) (or by the beneficiary following the death of the TOD account owner). The TOD account owner agrees that the Victory Funds will not be liable for any loss or expense resulting from any action taken or determination made in reliance upon such information.</li>
                    <li>All TOD account owners and the TOD account owner's legal representatives (or the beneficiary following the death of the TOD account owner(s), as appropriate, will indemnify the Victory Funds, each applicable Victory Fund, their respective officers, directors, trustees, employees, agents, successors, heirs and assigns and hold each of them harmless from any and all liability which may arise in connection with the establishment and maintenance of the TOD account and the performance of their obligations under this Agreement (including that which arises out of their own negligence or the negligence of their agents).</li>
                    <li>The TOD account is governed by the Delaware Uniform TOD Security Registration Act and the terms and conditions set forth in this Form, the applicable Victory Fund's prospectus and the Victory Funds Application.</li>
